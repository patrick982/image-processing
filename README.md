# Automatic underwater-image processing
this project should to automatically enhance images taken underwater without a lot of effort or complex, maybe expensive image manupulation tools

## Description
the program interface allows you to define a input and output folder on each run. It takes the input, processing earch image within the folder and puts the result into the output folder. The original input will be still available as it was. You can adjust the value of contrast- and color correction and hue shifts.
I put some values as default which I found pretty useful - I use a GoPro Hero 9 with some lighting setup - fyi

There is not much to add; since its pretty forward to use. Hopefully you find it a bit useful :)

## Getting started
### Dependencies
 - python3
 - PySimpleGUI
 - PIL
 - any OS that can run Python

### Installing & Executing
  - the program to use is the '''image_gui.py'''
  - either package an executeable with pyinstaller or similar
  - run the prgram with your favorite command line (i.e. PowerShell on Windows)
  - no further installation process needed

## Help
you can contact me, but everything should actually be pretty much self-explaining
